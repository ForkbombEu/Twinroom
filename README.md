# Gemini

Gemini is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that enables you to execute [slangroom contracts](https://dyne.org/slangroom) written in [Zencode language](https://dev.zenroom.org).

Contracts can be both embedded within the tool (compiled at build time) and added dynamically from specified folders (specified at runtime).

It also provides an easy way to list and run currently configured contracts both as CLI commands or as HTTP API endpoints served in daemon mode.

When dynamic run-time contract files have the same path as built-in embedded contracts, then the contracts placed in the contracts folder at build time have priority and will override the rest.

## Installation

To use Gemini, you need Go installed on your system. If you don't have Go installed, you can download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ForkbombEu/gemini
```
### Build the executable:
You can build the executable using either the go build command or the provided Makefile.
Using go build:

To build the binary with a custom name using go build, run:

```bash
go build -o <custom_name> .
```

Using make build:

```bash
make build BINARY_NAME=<custom_name>
```
If you want to specify a custom binary name, you can do so by passing the BINARY_NAME variable.

Replace <custom_name> with your desired binary name.
## Usage

### List Command

To list all slangroom files in a specified directory, use the following command:

```bash
./out/bin/gemini list <folder>
```
If you want to list only embedded filesin the contracts folder, simply run:

```bash
./out/bin/gemini list
```
### Run a file

To execute a specific slangroom file, use the following command:

```bash
out/bin/./gemini <folder> <file>
```

If the file is embedded, you can also run it directly by providing just the filename:


```bash
out/bin/./gemini  <file>
```

### Daemon Mode

Gemini can also run in daemon mode, exposing the slangroom files via an HTTP server. Use the -d or --daemon flag:

```bash
./out/bin/gemini -d <folder> <file>
```
If a folder is provided with the -d flag, Gemini will list the available slangroom files via HTTP.

```bash
./out/bin/gemini list  -d <folder>
```

### Examples

List all slang files in the examples folder:

```bash
./out/bin/gemini list examples
```

Run a specific slang file:

```bash
./out/bin/gemini examples hello
```
Start the HTTP server to expose the slang files:

```bash
./out/bin/gemini -d examples hello
```
